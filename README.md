# Daily-iPhone-App
iPhone App I published summer after my Sophomore of High School. Written entirely in C# via Xamarin. Daily delivered a Quote, Image, Word, and Weather report once daily. Every view was layed out entirely via programmatic autolayout. My decision to utilize autolayout in this way gave me a secure and robust understanding of the framework that I carried on with me through my other iOS projects. Daily enjoyed a short stint in the App Store from July 2015 until July 2016. I removed it after I switched to a private developer account away from my moms (since I was under 18) and some of the API endpoints became out of date.
